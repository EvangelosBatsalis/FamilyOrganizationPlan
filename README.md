# FamilyOrganizationPlan
Project about family organization plan. More specifically: toDo lists including grocery list, calendar events and share expenses for family and friends.

# use cases:

# for friends:
They will be split equally expenses.

# for families:
1. House toDo list plans separated by parents, and children. (on feature version will add grandparents, nanny, and cleaning lady).
2. Grocery store list with check boxes (separated by each family member).at future version it can be added another module which will be implement the grocery list with wolt to make instant order.
3. Common calendar for appointments and family needs including children.
5. split expenses include children's expenses. when a child add an expense a parent or parents must approve it first before added to money split.


# Divorced family organizations plan
1. when a parent deletes something it needs two for validation.
2. children can add expenses but both parents must be accepted.
3. children can add document for digital sign up e.g. school papers for school needs etc.
4. parents can digital sign up papers from any kind
5. my target is for divorced parents to be able to make transactions for the children and/or each other without the need to meet.
6. report about expenses and documents (most layers asked for this on court)

# another idea 1
1. diary for adults and children
2. with ai cooking ideas

the module will compare every market and find the most inexpensive cost of grocery list and might coop with wolt to directly add the shopping cart and make the order.

# another idea 2
in Holland I they scan the barcodes from super market and the barcode is giving them the galories of the product and if they are good or bad for health or if it's vegan of not.I am considering this to be like open contribute because it's difficult to track all food in the market. In addition I would like to use ai to give the person who scanned the barcode some food ingredient ideas for cooking.
